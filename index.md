<div style="text-align: justify; display: block; margin-right: auto;">

I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science, Islamia College Peshawar (Public Sector University), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. I'm also the Founder and Head of Digital Image Processing Lab. Previously, I was a leading researcher on the ALAMEDA project at NTNU Norway.

<br><strong>In academia</strong>, I maintain strong research collaborations with international institutions, particularly with the Intelligent Media Lab at Sejong University, Seoul, where I remotely supervise PhD and MS students on computer vision and deep learning projects. I also collaborate with researchers at NTNU Norway on advanced computer vision applications. My research spans multiple domains including medical image analysis, video summarization, content-based retrieval, and multimodal vision-language models, with over 7,900 citations and an h-index of 43.

<a id="education" class="anchor" href="#education" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Education</h2>
<p>I hold a PhD in Digital Contents/Computer Science from Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea (2012–2014), where I conducted research on "Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction using Adaptive Interpolation and Sparse Representation Based Methods." Prior to my PhD, I completed my MS in Computer Software Engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Pakistan (2005–2007), with research focused on "Image Magnification using Adaptive Interpolation by Pixel Level Data-Dependent Geometrical Shapes." My academic foundation includes an M.Sc in Computer Science from the University of Peshawar (2003–2005) and a B.Sc in Computer Science from the same institution (2001–2003).</p>
